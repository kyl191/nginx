# nginx mainline
This repo existed to build nginx mainline with Fedora packaging options on the Fedora copr infrastructure. It was associated with my nginx + pagespeed builds, which I not longer use & do not support.

[CentOS is getting newer builds](https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=2638), so there's no need for this repo to stick around.

You're welcome to fork this, but for now it's going into read only mode.
